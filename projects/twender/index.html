                twender is a small interactive web application that uses machine
                learning techniques to classify twitter users based on the text of
                their tweets.

                <p>

                <p>
                twender uses tweets that have been labeled based on the first name
                of the user to simplify the process of collecting training data. that is to 
                say the labels are not always correct. currently twender has 63% accuracy.
